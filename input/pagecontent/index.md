The US Core Testing Guide demonstrates the potential process that can be leveraged in FHIR IG authoring to provide formalized requirements and corresponding testing artifacts to aid in implementation efforts.

### About This Guide

During implementation guide authoring and the subsequent development of an implemenation to that guide, implementation teams benefit from formalized requirements and testing artifacts.

The goal of publishing this guide is to provide a potential standard approach to the definition, publication and use of formal testing processes.
